This code is used to calculate the substrate concentration of the product associated with the reaction between the enzyme alanine dehydrogenase and its substrate alanine.
Iterative root finding methods Halley's and Newton-Raphson were used to solve for the roots of the lambert w function associated with the Schnell-Mendoza equation.
The substrate concentration was then used to generate plots in order to compare the accuracy of lab experiments performed earlier.
